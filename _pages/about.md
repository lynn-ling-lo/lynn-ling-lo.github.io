### About Me
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, under the guidance of Prof. Wen-Huang Cheng and Prof. Hong-Han Shuai. Earlier, I received my B.S. degree from Deparment of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan. 
My research lies at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning, with a current focus on image immunization. In the earlier stages of my academic career, I delved into affective computing, specializing in facial and micro-expression recognition.
Currently, I'm broadening my research horizons as a visitor at the Vision and Learning Lab at the University of California, Merced, under the supervision of Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang.
