### About Me
I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, at the [AIMM Lab](https://aimm.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/index.html) under the mentorship of [Prof. Wen-Huang Cheng](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/zh_tw/member/Faculty/%E9%84%AD%E6%96%87%E7%9A%87-Wen-Huang-Cheng-80704716) and [Prof. Hong-Han Shuai](https://basiclab.lab.nycu.edu.tw/). I received my B.S. in Electronics from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan. I've also had the privilege to work with [Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/) and [Dr. Kelvin C.K. Chan] (https://ckkelvinchan.github.io/) from Google DeepMind during my time at UC Merced as a visiting student.
My research spans computer vision and machine learning, focusing on AI systems that understand and generate visual content. I began with affective computing and facial/micro expression recognition, and moved to concentrate on image/video generation with emphasis on precise generation and image immunization, developing techniques for more controllable content creation and protecting visual content from unauthorized manipulation. I'm passionate about bridging cutting-edge research with real-world impact, from developing robust defenses against deepfakes to exploring the potential of generative models.
