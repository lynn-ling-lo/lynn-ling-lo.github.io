### About Me
I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, at the [AIMM Lab](https://aimm.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/index.html) under the guidance of [Prof. Wen-Huang Cheng](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/zh_tw/member/Faculty/%E9%84%AD%E6%96%87%E7%9A%87-Wen-Huang-Cheng-80704716) and [Prof. Hong-Han Shuai](https://basiclab.lab.nycu.edu.tw/). I received my B.S. in Electronics from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan. 
My research lies at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning. Early in my academic journey, I focused on affective computing, particularly facial and micro-expression recognition. Recently, my work centers on image/video generation and its applications, including image immunization.
Currently, I am fortunate to be a visiting scholar at the [Vision and Learning Lab](http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/) at the University of California, Merced, working under the supervision of [Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/) and receiving guidance from [Dr. Kelvin C.K. Chan](https://ckkelvinchan.github.io/) at Google Deepmind.
